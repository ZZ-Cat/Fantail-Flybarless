# Contribution Rules for the Fantail Flybarless project

## Prime Directive
If it ain't broke... **DON'T FIX IT!**
If you have to second guess it... **DON'T DO IT!**
If in doubt... **LEAVE IT OUT!**
If all else fails... **RTFM!**

## The Rules (TL;DR)
 1. Fantail Flybarless is a no-nonsense project, by a no-nonsense developer.
 2. I, Cassandra "ZZ Cat" Robinson (AKA the owner & developer of Fantail Flybarless), reserve the right to have the final say on what goes into this project.
 3. Contributions are welcome. But, simply because you submitted a pull request, there is no guarantee that it will be added to the project.
 4. No marketing wank. Let the project speak for itself.
 5. Fantail Flybarless is DRM Free. Keep it that way.
 6. Fantail Flybarless is an ethical & safety conscious project. Once again, keep it that way.
 7. ...& as always, #KeepRCHelisAlive.

## The Rules (In detail)
Fantail Flybarless is a no-nonsense project, by a no-nonsense developer.
Contributions to the project are welcome, but not without their caveats.
Due to the inherent "danger factor" that's associated with radio controlled helicopters (honestly, do I have to spell it out to some people?
OK, I will. More on that later), any contributions will need to be stringently tested **before** it is merged with the existing firmware.
This means that, simply because you submitted a pull-request, that doesn't guarantee that it's gonna get merged with the project.
Everything is at my discretion - IE I have the final word on what goes into this project.
If, for any reason, I think what you've done is janky & may pose a potential safety hazard, I won't add it in & your request will be denied, without any notice
or reason.

"No nonsense" also means no marketing wank. Nothing grinds my gears more, than a product that's practically drowning in market wank-a-teering.
It says to me, that "this product is bloody awful, but we're compensating for it, by telling you how great it is & how little you have to fork out for it".
No! That doesn't work, Sunshine. Let the project speak for itself.

You will see on the front page (AKA The README file), Fantail Flybarless is DRM Free. This is something that I have adopted with all of my projects
& I expect you to keep it that way. For one thing, DRM is bloat-ware. DRM actually conflicts with the license of this project, as it implements countermeasures
against your rights granted to you by the license (AKA The GNU General Public License. If you haven't read that yet, get to it now **before** you finish reading
this document). I also consider myself to be an ethical software developer & electronics engineer; & as far as I can see, DRM conflicts with that principle.

Fantail Flybarless is an ethical & safety conscious project.
Radio controlled helicopters, regardless of their size, have an inherent risk of personal injury (or worse... death) if they are misused.
This is largely due to their main & tail rotors swinging the carbon fiber equivalent of knives at high speeds. Because of this inherent danger, one is expected
to assume all personal responsibility (& liability) that comes out of owning, building & flying a radio controlled helicopter.
Fantail's firmware is designed in such a way, as to minimize the risk of personal injury during normal operation. If a bug in the firmware causes a malfunction,
Fantail Flybarless must NOT, under any circumstances, cause the helicopter to become a danger to the pilot, or anyone that is in the immediate area of the
helicopter's operation. Fantail's source code makes extensive use of 'assert()' functions & exceptions wherever it is deemed necessary, to uphold the integrity
of safety. However, Fantail does not compensate for idiots, morons & jackasses... & it never will. So, stop expecting it to do so. Here's looking at you, Karen.
Flying the helicopter in a dangerous manner, whether intentional or unintentional, is the sole responsibility of the pilot.
